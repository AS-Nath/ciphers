**Encryption/Decryption**
This piece of software (built exclusively in Java) allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages
in 3 different ciphers:
<ul>
    Unicode-Exchange
    RSA
    AES
</ul>
<br>

*Unicode-Exchange*
This is a substitution cipher - each character is shifted a fixed number of times (input by the user)
in the Unicode set - and thus encrypted. This is the simplest form of cipher, and was even used by 
the Roman emperor/general Julius Caesar. The most basic version of this cipher is thus called the
Caesar cipher.
