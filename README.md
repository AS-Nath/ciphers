**Encryption/Decryption**
This piece of software (built exclusively in Java) allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages
<br>
in 3 different ciphers:
<ul>
    <li>Unicode-Exchange<li>
    <li>RSA<li>
    <li>AES<li>
</ul>
<br>

*Unicode-Exchange*
This is a substitution cipher - each character is shifted a fixed number of times (input by the user)
<br>
in the Unicode set - and thus encrypted. This is the simplest form of cipher, and was even used by 
<br>
the Roman emperor/general Julius Caesar. The most basic version of this cipher is thus called the
<br>
Caesar cipher.

*RSA*
